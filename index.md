**Abstract**

Social intelligence remains one of the most challenging capabilities to develop in AI systems. Existing benchmarks for social reasoning predominantly rely on oversimplified scenarios or unstructured dialogues, lacking the necessary structure to systematically investigate complex social cognitive mechanisms. A critical gap exists in platforms that can elicit and analyze fine-grained mental state dynamics in interactive social contexts.
Here we present **MindMaster**, a social interaction platform that captures the dynamic interplay between beliefs, intentions, values, and actions through structured role-play games. Unlike previous benchmarks, our approach provides interpretable annotations of mental states across extended interactions, enabling researchers to trace how reasoning evolves and influences decision-making in diverse social scenarios.
Our dataset establishes a foundation for training and evaluating AI systems on complex social reasoning tasks that more closely resemble human social intelligence. Our work advances computational social cognition while establishing rigorous standards for assessing genuine social capabilities in AI, a necessary step toward systems that can meaningfully integrate into human social environments.
